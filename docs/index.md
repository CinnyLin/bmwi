## About the Project 

This project is a collaboration with the [German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)](https://www.bmwi.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html), which represents the main governmental body in Germany for economic affairs and economic policy. Tasks of the BMWi include developing and implementing economic support programs and forecasting economic indicators that form the basis for tax revenue estimates and budget considerations of various governmental institutions. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, this project aims at robustifying BMWIâ€™s forecasts by developing a bottom-up forecasting model for predicting economic development in Germany based on regional data. The project will draw on fine-grained data on the demographic, economic and sectoral structure of regions with the aim of improving economic forecasts during times of shocks.
